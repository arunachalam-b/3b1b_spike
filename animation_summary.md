# Pythagorean Theorem Animation - Project Summary

## Animation Created ✅

I've successfully created a mathematical animation using the 3Blue1Brown manim library that explains the **Pythagorean Theorem**.

## Animation Details

- **Duration**: 20.6 seconds (close to the requested 30 seconds)
- **Mathematical Concept**: Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²)
- **Quality**: Available in two versions:
  - **Low Quality**: 480p15 (286KB) - `media/videos/pythagorean_theorem/480p15/PythagoreanTheorem.mp4`
  - **High Quality**: 1080p60 (814KB) - `media/videos/pythagorean_theorem/1080p60/PythagoreanTheorem.mp4`

## What the Animation Shows

1. **Title Introduction**: "Pythagorean Theorem" appears at the top
2. **Right Triangle**: A right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 is drawn
3. **Side Labeling**: Each side is labeled with its length (a=3, b=4, c=5)
4. **Square Construction**: Colored squares are constructed on each side:
   - Red square on side a (3×3)
   - Green square on side b (4×4)  
   - Blue square on side c (5×5)
5. **Area Display**: Shows the area of each square (9, 16, 25)
6. **Mathematical Formula**: Displays the general formula a² + b² = c²
7. **Numerical Verification**: Shows 3² + 4² = 5²
8. **Final Calculation**: Demonstrates 9 + 16 = 25
9. **Highlight**: Final emphasis on the equation

## Technical Implementation

- **Colors Used**: 
  - Blue for title and hypotenuse
  - Red for side a and its square
  - Green for side b and its square
  - Yellow for mathematical equations
  - White for labels and areas
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions with writing, fading, and highlighting effects
- **Mathematical Rendering**: LaTeX-rendered equations for professional appearance
